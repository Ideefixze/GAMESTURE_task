# Description
Task for Gamesture, needed for recrutation process.

Unity "game" window that displays three buttons with different functionalities:
1) shows up the pop-up window, uses default Unity Animation system with states
2) enables a text and starts up a Coroutine to disable it after 3 seconds
3) plays one of three sounds randomly

Below the third button there are SoundInclude(toggles) objects that change the inclusion of sounds in randomization. 
Number of sounds can be easily modified because SoundIncludes are added dynamically to the GUI Layout.

Done in Unity 2020.1.2f1 Personal.
